# Content Changed

I've coded this small Windows Forms app because I wanted to know when the new Apple Store was back online with new goodies without having to refresh it all the time.

## What does it do

Basically it gets the html of a url and compares it with the html fetched x ms later. If the content is different, you'll be notified.
